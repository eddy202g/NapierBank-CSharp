# NapierBank-CSharp
Message filtering system using C# with MVVM design pattern
<br>

<p>Designed for a software module for Napier University. The goal of this application was to build a system that would filter incoming texts, tweets and emails,
as well as handling abbreviations and quarantining URLs. </p>

The system was built using C# with the MVVM (model view viewmodel) pattern.

Standard libraries used are JSON, to handle saving the messages and Regex to filter the contents of the messages.
